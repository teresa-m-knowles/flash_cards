# Flashcards

This is a beginner project written in Ruby that loads a file with a set of cards, asks the questions to the user and provides feedback based on the user's input.

## Getting started

Clone this repository and run with the flashcard runner file
```
$ git clone git@github.com:teresa-m-knowles/flash_cards.git
cd flashcards
ruby lib/flashcard_runner.rb
```
The flashcards are in the cards.txt file, inside the flashcards folder. You can edit those and add your own categories, questions and answers.

Have fun!
