# Flashcards

This is a beginner project written in Ruby that loads a file with a set of cards, asks the questions to the user and provides feedback based on the user's input.

## Getting started

Clone this repository and run with the flashcard runner file
```
$ git clone git@github.com:teresa-m-knowles/flash_cards.git
cd flashcards
ruby lib/flashcard_runner.rb
```
The flashcards are in the cards.txt file, inside the flashcards folder. You can edit those and add your own categories, questions and answers.

Have fun!

## Self-Assessment

**Functionality**
3: Application adheres to the flow outlined and can handle different inputs. It can't handle totally invalid inputs though.


**Ruby Mechanics**
3: Appropriately uses Ruby's datatypes, enumerables and flow controls. Does not uses hashes though.


**Ruby Conventions**
3: Most classes and variable names follow proper convention. One or two variable names are not as clear as they could be.


**Testing**
3: Each class has a test file. All methods are appropriately tested and their names reflect the expected behavior


**Version Control**
4: 60 commits and 4 pull requests. Worked on different branches during the process and the commit messages clearly indicate the changes made.
